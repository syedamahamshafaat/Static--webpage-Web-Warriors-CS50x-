**Description:** 
This Web page "Web Warriors" is going to make many of the interactive programming and coding websites and courses easily acccessible to you. It consists of a couple of distinct links to websites such as edx, shecodes, codeacademy offering a variety of online coding courses with the provision of professional certificates and experience. Upon clicking a link, you are directed to that particular website. This path of programming will polish your coding skills and help you get better experience in different programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and many more. My idea behind this web page is to create a simple, styllistically captivating and easy to understand and access passage, encapsulating multiple opportunities for the coding learners out there.

 **Programming Languages and web framework used:**

# Flask:
Flask is a lightweight and extensible web framework for Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly build web applications with minimal boilerplate code. Since flask has numerous key features such as routing, templates and web server integration, I chose to apply it on my final project to make my web page "Web Warriors" less intricate and easily manageable. Since I build a very straightforward website, I created a single route and template known as index.html. This consumed less time but took great amendments. Conclusively, flask made my road to the development my site quite swift and easy.

# app.py:
This the file which includes a single route. Whenever the user visits my website, it will always be directed to the same page since there a single page. 

# HTML:
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It forms the backbone of web pages by defining the structure and layout of the content within a document. HTML involves a system of a variety of tags and attributes that allow us to improvise our website's layout and make it look well defined well designed. For this purpose I used HTML and created an HTML page called index.html in the folder of Templates. 

Upon a glimpse on this page, you can see I inserted a piece of JavaScript code within the Script tag. JavaScript is a programming language inducing creativity and augmenting interactiveness of a website by using different functions, procedures and commands. Therefore, in order to make my web page look a little eye catchy I applied this code to the slogan or the last part of page called footer, wherein I allowed this text "Explore, Create and Conquer with Web Warriors!" to run continiously. Moreover, if we scroll down, there is the body in which I used the div tag and embedded the image tag of programming backdrop and a paragragh tag in it. I adjusted the margins and color attributes of it and applied the .header class to this div tag.

Furthermore, we have another div in which I used the aside tag representing the left section of my web page. It contains a header tag wherein there is a h1 tag indicating a dominating slogan and a paragragh tag representing a short cause or motivation related to programming's future. To the div tag I applied the class .bar that is defined in my stylessheet style.css. Then I used hr and br tags to break the line and allow some transition. Afterwards, I applied the nav tag. This tag encapsulates all the links and images that can be accessed with just one click. There are total 7 links within it. With just one click the user is directed to that particular website through that link and look up for the intriguing coding, development and programming courses. Then, there is another hr tag for a soft break line followed by a h2 and a paragraph tags to allow user access more sites. 

Down there we have another div tag with a class color. I used ths to present some other well reputed and recognized coding learning platforms or website links such as cisco.programming, Harvard's cs50. Additionally, we have the main tag next defining the main area of the page holding some p, h1, img tags. Finally we have the footer tag which I used to enhance my page by running a meaningful slogan.

 # CSS:
I created a style sheet called styles.css in which I used different syntax and attributes to garnish my web page and be more creative. I involved different classes. The best part is that I also used animations transitions for e.g the keyframes feature where I selected five distinct percentages and assigned text-align attribute with unique values to them. This helped my slogan in the footer to steer left right and center swiftly. Moreover, I used animation feature with 3s infinite allowing the slogan to move in a loop of 3s.

 # Requirements.txt:
This file is created to specify and document the external dependencies, or third-party packages, that are required for the project to run. This file is used in conjunction with package management tools, such as pip, to install the specified versions of the required packages. My .requirements.txt file contains flask and python-dotenv.

#  Acknowledgement and gratitude:
I would like to thank the whole Cs50 staff and especially Sir David Malan who has been a great mentor and an instructor to me. Additionally, I am grateful for the support I got from different Cs50 communities. This course https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/ helped me learn great programming paths and introduced me to the diversified coding languages.
